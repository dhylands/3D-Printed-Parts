Initial mounts I used for mounting my TinyG controller
on my OX.

The v2 mount moves the whole TInyG board up by about 31.5mm so that it doesn't hang below the cross bar.
I'm going to rotate my X stepper by 90 degrees so that the wires exit on the side rather than the bottom
and then it should still clear the TinyG board.
